;;;;  Acquiring a copy of Sfy
;;;;

Sfy is stored in a GIT repository (http://git.or.cz/).  To make a local copy of
the current stable versin of Sfy, you will need to:

1)  Create a clone of the GIT repository.
2)  Change to the stable branch of Sfy.

Assuming you have a working version of GIT, the following should work:

1)  git clone /projects/pmheider/sfy-stable/.git
2)  cd sfy-stable
3)  git checkout -b tiny-stable

Be sure to localize the variables to your particular installation.

;;;;
;;;;  Localizing Sfy
;;;;

BOOT.CL contains several variable folder names that need to be set to localize
any installation of Sfy.

For users on nickelback.buffalo.edu, the following variables should be updated:

  --  *SFY-DIRECTORY*
  --  *PREDICATE-DICTIONARY-DIR*

For users on any other system, they will need to also change the values of
these additional variables:

  --  *LKB-DIRECTORY*
  --  *ERG-DIRECTORY*
  --  *LOAD-SNEPS-COMMAND*

The directories for Sfy, LKB, and ERG have to be set multiple times for now
because of a scoping bug.

The predicate dictionaries are kept in a sub-directory of Sfy by default.

The other user-defined variables will be explained below:

*USE-FIRST-PARSE*
*BOOTSTRAP-LEXICON*
*INCLUDE-PHONOLOGY*

*SFY-VERBOSE-MODE*
*SFY-DEMO-MODE*

*SFY-CHESS-MODE*
*SFY-ISA-MODE*
*SFY-ISACAN-MODE*
*SFY-ISA-COMPLEX-MODE*
*SFY-ISACAN-COMPLEX-MODE*

;;;;
;;;;  Running Sfy
;;;;

From within your preferred means of running ALISP, execute the command:

1)  (load "boot")

A single sentence at a time (e.g., "Kim is an elephant") may be parsed by
running the command:

1)  (sfy::parse "Kim is an elephant.")
